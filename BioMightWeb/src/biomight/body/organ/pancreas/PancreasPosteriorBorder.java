 *
 * The pancreas is a compound racemose gland, analogous in its structures to the salivary glands, 
 * though softer and less compactly arranged than those organs. Its secretion, the pancreatic juice, 
 * carried by the pancreatic duct to the duodenum, is an important digestive fluid. The pancreas has 
 * an important internal secretion, probably elaborated by the cells of Langerhans, which is taken 
 * up by the blood stream and is concerned with sugar metabolism. It is long and irregularly 
 * prismatic in shape; its right extremity, being broad, is called the head, and is connected to 
 * the main portion of the organ, or body, by a slight constriction, the neck; while its left 
 * extremity gradually tapers to form the tail. It is situated transversely across the posterior 
 * wall of the abdomen, at the back of the epigastric and left hypochondriac 
 * regions. Its length varies from 12.5 to 15 cm., and its weight from 60 to 100 gm.
