	// The primary lobules vary in size from that of a pin's head to that of a small pea
	// and are made up of a number of small nodules or follicles, which are irregular in 
	// shape and are more or less fused together, especially toward the interior of the gland. 
	// Each follicle is from 1 to 2 mm in diameter and consists of a medullary and a cortical portion, 
	// and these differ in many essential particulars from each other. The cortical portion is mainly 
	// composed of lymphoid cells, supported by a network of finely-branched epithelial cells, which 
	// is continuous with a similar network in the medullary portion.
