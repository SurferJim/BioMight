 * The bronchioles are the first airway branches that no longer contain cartilage. They are 
 * branches of the bronchi, and are smaller than one millimeter in diameter.  
 * There are no glands or cartilage in any of the bronchioles, and the epithelial cells 
 * become more cuboidal in shape.  The bronchioles terminate by entering the circular sacs called alveoli.
