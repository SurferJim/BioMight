 *
 * The lungs contain about 300 million alveoli, representing a total surface area of 70-90 square metres, 
 * each wrapped in a fine mesh of capillaries.  The alveoli have radii of about 0.1 mm and wall thicknesses 
 * of about 0.2 µm.
 * 
 * The alveoli consist of an epithelial layer and extracellular matrix surrounded by capillaries. In some 
 * alveolar walls there are pores between alveoli. There are three major alveolar cell types in the alveolar 
 * wall (pneumocytes):
 * 
 * Type I cells that form the structure of an alveolar wall
 * Type II cells that secrete surfactant to lower the surface tension of water and allows the membrane to 
 * 	separate thereby increasing the capability to exchange gases.
 * Type III cells that destroy foreign material, such as bacteria.
 * 
 * The alveoli have an innate tendency to collapse (atelectasis) because of their spherical shape, 
 * small size, and surface tension due to water vapor. Phospholipids, which are called surfactants, 
 * and pores help to equalize pressures and prevent collapse.
