 * In the neighborhood of the spleen, and especially in the gastrolienal ligament and greater omentum, 
 * small nodules of splenic tissue may be found, either isolated or connected to the spleen by thin 
 * bands of splenic tissue. They are known as accessory spleens (lien accessorius; supernumerary spleen). 
 * They vary in size from that of a pea to that of a plum.
