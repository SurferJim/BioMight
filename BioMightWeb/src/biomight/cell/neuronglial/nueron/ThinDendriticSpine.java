 * A dendritic spine is a small membranous extrusion that protrudes from a dendrite and forms 
 * one half of a synapse. Typically spines have a bulbous head (the spine head) which is connected 
 * to the parent dendrite through a thin spine neck. Dendritic spines are found on the dendrites of
 * most principal neurons in the brain including cortical pyramidal neurons, medium spiny neurons of 
 * the striatum and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum.
