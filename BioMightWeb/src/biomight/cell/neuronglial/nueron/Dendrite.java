 *
 * Dendrites are the branched projections of a neuron that act to conduct the electrical stimulation 
 * received from other neural cells to the cell body, or soma, of the neuron from which the dendrites 
 * project. Electrical stimulation is transmitted onto dendrites by upstream neurons via synapses 
 * which are located at various points throughout the dendritic arbor. Dendrites play a critical role 
 * in integrating these synaptic inputs and in determining the extent to which action potentials are 
 * produced by the neuron.
