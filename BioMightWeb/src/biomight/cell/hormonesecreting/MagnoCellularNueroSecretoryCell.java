 * Magnocellular neurosecretory cells are large cells within the supraoptic nucleus and 
 * paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. They are also found in smaller numbers in 
 * accessory cell groups between these two nuclei, the largest one being the nucleus circularis. 
 * There are two types of magnocellular neurosecretory cells, oxytocin-producing cells and 
 * vasopressin-producing cells, but a small number can produce both hormones. These cells are 
 * neuroendocrineneurons, they are electrically excitable, and generate action potentials in 
 * response to afferent stimulation.
